The task of the workshop is an independent implementation of the algorithm for simulation event modeling of discrete systems (on the example of queuing systems).

Task: It is required to develop a program that implements discrete-event modeling of the system considered in task 2 of homework No. 4. Please note that all time intervals obey the laws of distributions, which are continuous. Therefore, it is categorically wrong to choose integer data types for moments and time intervals, and even more so for a model time increment with a unit step. It is necessary to implement the transition from event to event, as is done in GPSS and other problem-oriented systems. To simplify, we can restrict ourselves to using a single stream of random numbers to generate all the necessary random variables. The result of the program operation should be a log file containing entries like: “At time 12.345, a transaction with ID 1 entered the model”, “At time 123.456, a transaction with ID 123 entered queue 1”, “At time 234.567, a transaction with ID 234 occupied device 2”, “At time 345.678 transaction with ID 345 released device 1”, “At time 456.789 transaction with ID 456 exited the model”.
